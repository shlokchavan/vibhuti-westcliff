        <h3>Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?</h3>
        <!-- primary content -->
        <p>
          Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here
          looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred
          way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best of all, there are so
          many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. For
          instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than
          buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or finding a kitten for sale
          from a litter.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more benefits as well. Since pets in rescues and shelters
          usually come from a home where the owners ran out of money, got
          divorced, or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs and cats
          on our website are already housetrained, good with kids, or do well
          with other pets.
        </p>

        <p>
          People are finding out that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder
          isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the dogs and cats don't leave the
          organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet.
          That means less stress, and more savings! So what are you waiting for?
          Go find that perfect pet!
        </p>

        <h3>The Experts & Tools You Need to Find the Perfect Pet</h3>
        <p>
          Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for?
          Wait a second, did we just say personality, and not breed? Yes, that
          is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family should start
          with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do
          you need a dog that is low key and good with kids, or are you looking
          for an energetic pal who is into trail running? Perhaps a cat that
          will get along well with others is what you need.
        </p>

          you are experts at matching you with a dog or cat who will love the
